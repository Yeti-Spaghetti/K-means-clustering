# K-means-clustering
My Python implementation of K-means clustering which assigns labels to un-labeled data.

# Existing problems
- Number assigned to each centroid doesn't always match actual centroid numbers
- Centroids not always correct either. If centroids initialized too close together, 2 centroids end up sharing / splitting 1 cluster.
